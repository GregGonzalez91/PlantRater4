# PlantRater4

Plant Rater is a Full Stack WebMVC project deployed on Microsoft Azure. This application allows a user to Rate plants based on difficulty to grow. 

It is the overall goal of this application to be further developed to allow a community of users to see how different plants rate to help them decide which plant to grow for themselves!

The target audience are for anyone looking to share their experience with growing different plants or trees by rating them. 

Why did I build this? Often when people want to start growing plants they might choose a difficult plant and that plant then dies. With this Application the goal is to have a place where users who want to start growing plants can determine what plant might be best to start out with. That was the user experience from gardening or growing is improved and encouraged. 

## How it works:
Plant Rater is fully equppied with CRUD that permits users to log in, then create, view, update or delete plants, colors or trees. Users are able to Rate their experience with each plant or tree.

IMPORTANT:
To add data for creating plants you must first create colors. The Colors Table contains the data needed in order to create plants. 
1. Register as a user.
2. Select the "Color" Tab in the Navigation Bar.
3. Create your personal list of colors. 
4. Now start creating and rating plants!
